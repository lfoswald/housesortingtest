Wizardy school house sorting test on the basis of personality traits 


A few years ago, in a group of 5 psychology students, we were supposed to develop a personality test in the course of a psychometrics course.
To make the course somewhat more interesting, we decided to mimik a famous sorting test from the probably most famous school of wizardy on the basis of various existing personality trait and motivation scales. 

We were all so excited about the project, that years after the course, we kept telling the story to friends and family. People kept asking us "Oh cool, can you launch the survey again? I would like to know my house!". In fact, we did this several times - launched the survey via a third party service and analyzed the data with a buggy R-Script, again and again. Therefore, I decided to make this test my first R-Shiny project.
